# Data-for-nfldb-gsis_id-2017111911
Missing game data (from Ochawkeye (github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/issues/298)

These .tsv files are provided for those individuals who wish to update their nfldb databases.
They are only necessary if you were (are) missing game 2017111911 in your schedule.json file.

The motivation for this came from "Missing 2017 and 2018 schedule data #298" issue on github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/issues/298

Ochawkeye provided his schedule.json file for those (like myself) who were having trouble with nfldb-update.

That file is missing the game info for gsis_id = 2017111911.
As a result, when nfldb-update is run (successfully), it does not insert data for game 2017111911.

The .tsv file provided here have the data (by table and field) for this game.

As noted, agg_play does not need to be loaded into the database because it is automatically generated bye the triggers in play_player
